# Blue Carbon Registry Architecture

## System Overview

The Blue Carbon Registry is a decentralized platform for managing carbon credits using blockchain technology. The system consists of multiple layers working together to provide transparency and verifiability for carbon offset projects.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Blockchain Layer (Solana)
- **Smart Contracts**: Core business logic for carbon credit management
- **SPL Tokens**: Carbon credits represented as fungible tokens
- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Deterministic account addresses
- **Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)**: Integration with SPL Token Program

### 2. Frontend Applications
- **Web Application**: Dashboard for project management and trading
- **Mobile Application**: Field data collection and verification
- **Shared Components**: Common UI elements and utilities

### 3. Backend Services
- **IPFS Bridge**: Upload and retrieve project metadata
- **Data Aggregation**: Process field reports and drone imagery
- **API Gateway**: Unified access point for client applications

### 4. Data Storage
- **On-chain**: Project registration, credit issuance, transfers
- **IPFS**: Project documentation, images, reports
- **Local**: Raw sensor data, temporary files

## Data Flow

1. **Project Registration**
   - Project developer submits documentation
   - Metadata uploaded to IPFS
   - Project registered on blockchain with IPFS hash

2. **Credit Issuance**
   - Field data collected via mobile app
   - Verification through backend services
   - Credits minted as SPL tokens

3. **Credit Trading**
   - Marketplace facilitates transfers
   - All transactions recorded on-chain
   - Real-time balance updates

4. **Credit Retirement**
   - Users retire credits for offset claims
   - Credits transferred to burn address
   - Permanent record of retirement

## Security Considerations

- PDA-based access control
- Multi-signature requirements for large transactions
- Audit trails for all operations
- IPFS content addressing for tamper-proof metadata

## Scalability

- Solana's high throughput (65,000 TPS)
- IPFS distributed storage
- Client-side processing where possible
- Efficient state management
